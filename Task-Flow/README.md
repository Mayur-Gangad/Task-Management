# TaskFlow – A Jira-like Task Management Board  

TaskFlow is a modern, Jira-like task management board built with React. It lets users create tasks with tags and statuses, organize them across visual columns, and update them using smooth drag-and-drop interactions. Tasks are stored in **localStorage**, ensuring data persists even after a page refresh.
